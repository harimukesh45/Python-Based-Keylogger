# Python-Based-Keylogger
This project is a Python-based keylogger developed to demonstrate how keylogging tools work in real-world scenarios. It is intended solely for ethical hacking, cybersecurity training, and educational research.  The keylogger captures and logs keystrokes typed on the keyboard and stores them securely in a local file.
